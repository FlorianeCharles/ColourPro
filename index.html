<b> Balayage </b>
<div class=balayageimage> <img src="balayage-c.jpg"/> </div>
  This style comes from the French word “Balayer” which means to sweep, and aims to create natural sun-kissed highlights. It is softer and less noticeable than highlights, giving it a more natural look. This style emulates the parts of your hair that would normally be highlighted by just being under the sun. This is a free hand technique, meaning there is no foil or meche used.
  Price starts at $100

This technique looks similar to balayage in the end if you are going for a softer look, but does invovle bleach and foil compared to balayage which is done free hand. This also means you can be more precise with where you want your highlights compared to with the balayage technique. You can also go less natural than balayage if you are looking for a more dramatic look or bigger contrast!

<div class=Ombre>
<b> Ombre </b>
<div class=ombreimage> <img src="ombre-c.jpg"/> </div>
  This technique comes from the French word “ombre” which means shade. This looks is a little more dramatic and less natural looking. It consists of keeping the roots darker and gradually having the tips becoming lighter. This can however also be done in any other colour. There is also a type of ombré called sombré, where the two tones are not as dramatic, giving it a softer look.
