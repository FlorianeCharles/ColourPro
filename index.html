<div class=Balayage>
<b> Balayage </b>
<div class=balayageimage> <img src="balayage-c.jpg"/> </div>
  This style comes from the French word “Balayer” which means to sweep, and aims to create natural sun-kissed highlights. It is softer and less noticeable than highlights, giving it a more natural look. This style emulates the parts of your hair that would normally be highlighted by just being under the sun. This is a free hand technique, meaning there is no foil or meche used.

<div class=highlights>
<b> Highlights </b>
<div class=highlightimage> <img src="highlights-c.jpg"/> </div>
Highlights can sometimes look similar to the balayage technique, but this does involve bleach and foil. Compared to balayage, you can be more precise with where you want your highlights and how contrasted they are. You can go less natural if you are looking for a more dramatic look, or don't want to involve your entire hair in the change! This is considered a variation of Balayage.

</div><div class=Ombre>
<b> Ombre </b>
<div class=ombreimage> <img src="ombre-c.jpg"/> </div>
  This technique comes from the French word “ombre” which means shade. This looks is a little more dramatic and less natural looking. It consists of keeping the roots darker and gradually having the tips becoming lighter. This can be done in any other colour (for example red or blue tips). There is also a type of ombré called sombré, where the two tones are not as dramatic, giving it a softer look.
